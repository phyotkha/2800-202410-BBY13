Below are several sample user questions related to the MongoDB document provided, 
and the corresponding MongoDB aggregation pipeline queries that can be used to fetch the desired data.
Use them wisely.

Question 1: How many students are in the CST major?

Query:
json
[
  { "$match": { "major": "CST" } },
  { "$group": { "_id": "$major", "total_students": { "$sum": 1 } } },
  { "$project": { "major": "$_id", "total_students": 1, "_id": 0 } }
]


Question 2: What are the details of the student with the student ID A0134567?

Query:
json
[
  { "$match": { "studentId": "A0134567" } },
  { "$project": { "first_name": 1, "last_name": 1, "date_of_birth": 1, "email": 1, "major": 1, "year": 1, "courses": 1, "_id": 0 } }
]


Question 3: List all students who are in their final year.

Query:

[
  { "$match": { "year": 2024 } },
  { "$project": { "studentId": 1, "first_name": 1, "last_name": 1, "major": 1, "year": 1, "_id": 0 } }
]


Question 4: What are the courses taken by the student with the student ID A0134567?

Query:
json
[
  { "$match": { "studentId": "A0134567" } },
  { "$lookup": {
      "from": "courses",
      "localField": "courses.CourseID",
      "foreignField": "CourseID",
      "as": "course_details"
    }
  },
  { "$project": { "studentId": 1, "course_details": 1, "_id": 0 } }
]


Question 5: Find the total number of students for each major.

Query:
json
[
  { "$group": { "_id": "$major", "total_students": { "$sum": 1 } } },
  { "$project": { "major": "$_id", "total_students": 1, "_id": 0 } }
]


Each of these queries is designed to run within MongoDB's aggregation framework to extract specific information based on the user's questions.
 The `$project` step is used to format the output to include only relevant fields.
