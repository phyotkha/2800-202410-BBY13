This plan does have comprehensive travel medical coverage. For this plan to be valid, you must already be enrolled in MSP. Check Plan Enrollment or contact healthplan@bcitsa.ca if you are unsure if you are enrolled. For more information about travel coverage through the BCITSA Health & Dental Plan see: Plan Details, Emergency travel coverage booklet, Travel Medical Assistance Card (keep a copy of this with you when you go abroad). If you are not enrolled in the BCITSA Health & Dental Plan, you should plan to purchase your own medical insurance policy such as a Guard.me Global Outbound policy.", "url": "https://www.bcit.ca/international-mobility/outbound-student-guide/"}

{"title": "Outbound Student Guide", "section": "Post-graduation work permit considerations", "content": "(only for international students) If you hold a Canadian study permit and are considering studying a term or more abroad, you should be aware that it could have implications should you wish to later apply for a PGWP. The key point to understand is that only time spent studying towards your program in Canada may count towards the length of your PGWP. If you complete a program but didn’t study at least 8 months of that program in Canada then you may not be eligible for a PGWP at all.", "url": "https://www.bcit.ca/international-mobility/outbound-student-guide/"}
