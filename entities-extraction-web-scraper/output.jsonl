BCIT School of Business + Media invited over 35 Burnaby high school students to solve real-world problems for local businesses using business and accounting concepts at our annual case competition. Participating high school students received three weekly 2-hour mentorship sessions with BCIT School of Business + Media student mentors. During these sessions, students were taught how to analyze, solve, and present a business case study in preparation for competition day through a practice case. On competition day, students had around 3 hours to prepare their final business case and presentation. All teams presented their solution to a panel of five industry judges at the Telus Theatre. Case presentations were 8-10 minutes in length. Following the presentation, judges provided feedback to the students. The teams were then judged on the practicality and value of their solutions and the quality of their presentations. Awards were given to the top 3 teams. This year, the winners received a BCIT plaque made with wood from the Burnaby campus.", "About the Competition": "The BCIT School of Business + Media\u2019s recent High School Case Competition was more than an academic event \u2013 it was a dynamic showcase of talent and innovation.

It includes the management of harmful wastes and chemicals in a way the reduces their negative impact on the natural and human world. On a social level, SDG 12 is a call to action for humans to build sustainable lifestyles that are in harmony with nature, and to build green jobs that promote local cultures, experiences and products. BCIT\u2019s Sustainability [Policy 1010](https://www.bcit.ca/files/pdf/policies/1010.pdf) [PDF] emphasizes our aspiration of being a zero waste organization. As part of the application of this policy, BCIT aims to improve, monitor, and report on its performance in sustainability when it comes to the procurement of goods and services, as well as facilities management and waste management. We recognize that at the forefront of this challenge is our approaches to managing waste. Campus wide waste audits are conducted every few years to identify the amount of total waste collected and diverted from landfill or incineration. These statistics are used to track our program\u2019s effectiveness and to ensure compliance with Metro Vancouver\u2019s waste management guidelines. When reflecting on SDG 12, we understand the key role that reducing, repurposing, reusing and recycling plays in our campus operations. However, we further recognize the importance of addressing our overall ecological footprint and the role we have to play in encouraging our community to do the same. The BCIT Bookstore has teamed up with Textbooks For Change, who sends donated textbooks to partner campus libraries in Africa.
