On a social level, SDG 12 is a call to action for humans to build sustainable lifestyles that are in harmony with nature, and to build green jobs that promote local cultures, experiences and products. BCIT\u2019s Sustainability Policy 1010 [PDF] emphasizes our aspiration of being a zero waste organization. As part of the application of this policy, BCIT aims to improve, monitor, and report on its performance in sustainability when it comes to the procurement of goods and services, as well as facilities management and waste management. We recognize that at the forefront of this challenge is our approaches to managing waste. Campus wide waste audits are conducted every few years to identify the amount of total waste collected and diverted from landfill or incineration. These statistics are used to track our program\u2019s effectiveness and to ensure compliance with Metro Vancouver\u2019s waste management guidelines. When reflecting on SDG 12, we understand the key role that reducing, repurposing, reusing and recycling plays in our campus operations. However, we further recognize the importance of addressing our overall ecological footprint and the role we have to play in encouraging our community to do the same.

BCIT School of Business + Media invited over 35 Burnaby high school students to solve real-world problems for local businesses using business and accounting concepts at our annual case competition. Participating high school students received three weekly 2-hour mentorship sessions with BCIT School of Business + Media student mentors. During these sessions, students were taught how to analyze, solve, and present a business case study in preparation for competition day through a practice case. On competition day, students had around 3 hours to prepare their final business case and presentation. All teams presented their solution to a panel of five industry judges at the Telus Theatre. Case presentations were 8-10 minutes in length. Following the presentation, judges provided feedback to the students. The teams were then judged on the practicality and value of their solutions and the quality of their presentations. Awards were given to the top 3 teams. This year, the winners received a BCIT plaque made with wood from the Burnaby campus. About the Competition The [BCIT School of Business + Media](https://www.bcit.ca/business-media/)'s recent High School Case Competition was more than an academic event \u2013 it was a dynamic showcase of talent and innovation. Drawing in over 30 high school students from secondary schools in Burnaby, this competition exemplified the hands-on and industry-focused approach to learning at BCIT. Sponsored by Chartered Professional Accountants British Columbia (CPA BC), and student club Enactus BCIT, the case competition provided a rare chance for young minds to tackle real-world business challenges.

It includes the management of harmful wastes and chemicals in a way the reduces their negative impact on the natural and human world. On a social level, SDG 12 is a call to action for humans to build sustainable lifestyles that are in harmony with nature, and to build green jobs that promote local cultures, experiences and products. BCIT\u2019s Sustainability [Policy 1010](https://www.bcit.ca/files/pdf/policies/1010.pdf) [PDF] emphasizes our aspiration of being a zero waste organization. As part of the application of this policy, BCIT aims to improve, monitor, and report on its performance in sustainability when it comes to the procurement of goods and services, as well as facilities management and waste management. We recognize that at the forefront of this challenge is our approaches to managing waste. Campus wide waste audits are conducted every few years to identify the amount of total waste collected and diverted from landfill or incineration. These statistics are used to track our program\u2019s effectiveness and to ensure compliance with Metro Vancouver\u2019s waste management guidelines. When reflecting on SDG 12, we understand the key role that reducing, repurposing, reusing and recycling plays in our campus operations. However, we further recognize the importance of addressing our overall ecological footprint and the role we have to play in encouraging our community to do the same. The BCIT Bookstore has teamed up with Textbooks For Change, who sends donated textbooks to partner campus libraries in Africa.

SPs are also informed of the learning goals, and the \u201cexpected learner actions,\u201d so they have some idea of what will likely happen in the encounter. Depending on the circumstances, in a simulation the students may: Listen to the heart and lungs, Press on the abdomen, Take blood pressure, pulse and temperature, Look into the eyes, ears, nose and throat, Ask the SP to follow instructions for a neurological exam (touch your finger to your nose, walk on this line, and other simple tests), Provide basic care to make their patient more comfortable, Offer advice or counselling to help their SP better manage the health condition being investigated.
